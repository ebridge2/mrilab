The data is uploaded directly to AWS S3 cloud drives. The controller then initiates the Batch deployment procedure at (2.a), which interfaces between S3 and EC2 cloud computers to provide the MRI scans to EC2 instances pre-loaded with the FNGS pipeline for analysis. After the scans are finished being analyzed on the EC2 instances at (2.b), the results are then re-uploaded back to the S3 cloud drive at (2.c). The user can then navigate to the S3 cloud drive for downstream analyses.\n",
